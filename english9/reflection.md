This artifact is a website I created in English to explain plagiarism and how it is used in writing. We had the choice to choose many platforms to demonstrate plagiarism. This was a Group or Single Person project, I chose Single Person.

This artifact relates to my future because I'm interested in computer programming and web design. This was my second web design project where it was being used in school, and as such it was opened for some criticism. I intend to learn more about web design and create projects that are useful in every day life. The most important thing I learned from this project was how simple it is to plagiarise, and how to better prevent it.
