This artifact is a website I created in Chemistry to explain how Gallium is used in LEDs and what Gallium is. We had the choice to choose almost any tool to show how certain elements are used in everyday life. This was a single person project.

This artifact relates to my future because I'm interested in computer programming and web design. This was my first major web project people more than just me would be seeing, and as such opened it for constructive criticism. I intend to learn more about programming in general and create projects that gradually become more lightweight and better looking. The most important thing I learned from this project was to not take on projects larger than I can handle.
