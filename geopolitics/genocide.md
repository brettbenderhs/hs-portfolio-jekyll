The Bosnian genocide all began when the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina decided to declare independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. Quickly thereafter the region became an area of conflict, the perfect stage for an ethnic cleansing. The genocide specifically attacked Bosniak and Croatian citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, claiming ~100,000 lives, and displacing at least 2 million.

Yugoslavia had began to collapse in 1991, once the Slovenia & Croatian republics split off. This was shortly followed with the Yugoslavic army invading Croatia, representing just the beginning of the ethnic cleansing. The army consisting mainly of Serbs, entered into Croatia, saying they were trying to protect the ethnic Serbs, but instead committed mass executions. In 1992, it was Bosnia's turn.

Following the Bosnian declaration of independence, the Serbs began their attempt to ethnically cleanse the Bosniak territory. The Serbs surrounded Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, and hid in the mountains and hills, often shooting at citizens who tried to get food or water. Unfortunately, that's not where it ended; mass executions, concentration camps, and rape were commonplace. Thousands were killed in a timespan of less than four years; and despite attempts of intervention by the European Union and the United Nations flatly refusing to intervene, the peacekeepers in Bosnia did not have the capacity to protect the people seeking refuge, and much of Bosnia came under Serbian control. 

July 1995 marked the beginning of the Genocide at Srebrenica, in which 8,372 men and boys were killed, over just a 4 day period. Many women and girls were set to be tortured, raped, and put through other forms of sexual violence, in the hopes that the Bosniak heritage might be ended. Even though it was clear an attack on Srebrenica was being planned, no international intervention took place.

To finally end the war in Bosnia, the Dayton Accords were drafted in Dayton, Ohio, on November 1, 1995, and formally being signed December 14. The accords put an end to the 3.5 year long Bosnian war and genocide. Today the Bosnian genocide is considered the worst set of horrors on European soil after the Holocaust.
