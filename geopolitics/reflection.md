This artifact is an essay I created in Geopolitics to explain the Bosnian genocide. We had the ability to choose whatever format we wanted to demonstrate an understanding of your given genocide. This was a medium sized research essay I did great on.

This artifact relates to my future because in college you have to write research essays. This was one of my many Algebra quizzes I have taken in school, and as such it was expected to be done well. I intend to learn more about mathematics and relate it to computer programming. The most important thing I learned from this quiz is that sometimes the greatest mistakes, are the most simple.
