This artifact is a quiz I took in Spanish I near the end of the year, demonstrating my ability to learn new languages. We had the choice of what terms we put on the quiz, learning what animals & terms we felt were more closely related to our lives.

This relates to my future as a person able to speak multiple languages often has many more opportunities in jobs. A higher level of knowledge and understanding also comes with the ability to speak multiple langauges. Learning spanish will allow me the ability of potentially talking with native Spanish speakers in other countries if I ever travel the world.
