This artifact is a quiz I completed in Algebra II to show proficiency in systems of linear equations and solving them. We had the ability to use our notes to refresh our knowledge during this quiz. This was a three section quiz of which I did quite well on.

This artifact relates to my future because I'm interested in computer programming and mathematics. This was one of my many Algebra quizzes I have taken in school, and as such it was expected to be done well. I intend to learn more about mathematics and relate it to computer programming. The most important thing I learned from this quiz is that sometimes the greatest mistakes, are the most simple.
