title: Sophomore End of Year Reflection
subtitle: Brett Bender
---
This past school year, was quite hectic towards the end, but I still grew both academically and socially. Participating in Forensics & Cross Country, allowed me to find new friends, and reminisce with old. With my brain absorbing, ever more knowlege, I grew greatly academically. Throughout the year I was also the Technology Assistant, which allowed me to take a peek at what decisions go into what students end up seeing, and in some cases, absolutely hating administration for. The coronavirus put a damper on the situation, but I tried to make the most out of it.

I learned little about myself in the past year, at least that I can remember. Project based tests are still my strong suit, and working under pressure is still my favorite. These end up being represented well on this website, with unfinished sections and blank pages hidden around. The jokes I was able to fit in on the site also reflect my sense of humor quite well.

Throughout the year, my level of participation stayed quite constant, as I tried to be involved in as much as I could, but still maintain a balance with education. Forensics was, once again, a great experience to be a part of; I was able to demonstrate and explain to others the mentality behind being a freelance developer, and give them a better understanding of how to become one, should they want to. After my speech, I often got a few questions, which allowed me to spread my message even better.

Throughout the year, I had several valuable experiences, but the one I'd consider most important, is fourth quarter. Fourth quarter taugth me a lot about how to better maintain a work ethic, and manage your time. I had some difficulties staying focused on my school work, but I was able to get through it.

This very portfolio is standing up to be a representation of me as a person. Being *semi* custom built, it's like no other's, being unique, exactly like me. It has it's strengths and weaknesses, but I've grown to love them. Through the next years of high school, it will continue to get better, and reflect me more as a person. Overall, this past year was crazy, but I enjoyed the experience. Here's to hoping next year is just as good, or better.
