title: Freshman End of Year Reflection

Throughout this past school year I have grown greatly academically and socially. Being a member of Cross County, Track, and Forensics gave me great chances to meet new people and form friendships that will last for great time to come. Academically I gained knowledge, even during times we didn't think we were learning *ahem Mr. Gilbert's rants ahem*, and in fact those times were when we learned the most.

In the pastyear of High School I learned many things about myself, like how I work better under pressure, project based tests are my strong suit, and learning other languages comes naturally. These things are quite well represented in my portfolio, as both of my website artifacts were done only a few days before the due date, and the Spanish quiz, at least to me, was quite easy.

My level of participation in the year, both greatly increased, and made great changes to my social attitude. For me Forensics was the most important, as I was able to create a demonstration on card throwing, something I was interested in and excited to do. I learned with this great program that speaking and demonstrating comes naturally for me, as after my speeches everyone wanted to try.

The most valuable experience I had this year was going to the County Youth Government Day to learn more on how the county is actually ran. From this experience I gained the knowledge to be a better president of the FLIP organization.

This portfolio is a great reflection of who I am as a person, a kinda geeky, but funny sort of guy. My portfolio has many strengths and weaknesses, the most important weakness being the inability to edit it as easily. I can improve on it through my years by adding more features, updating the appearance, and making it in general.
