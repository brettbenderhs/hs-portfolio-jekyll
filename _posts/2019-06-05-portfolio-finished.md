title: Portfolio Finished

After many weeks of procrastination the portfolio has finally been finished, if you notice something wrong or missing from it, please create an issue over at [Github][github-issues]. The design of the portfolio is subject to change, and it likely will through my years of High School.

**Thanks!**
